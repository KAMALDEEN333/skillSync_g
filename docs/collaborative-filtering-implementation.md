# Collaborative Filtering Implementation for Mentor-Mentee Matching

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of collaborative filtering algorithms for mentor-mentee recommendations in the SkillSync platform. The system combines user-based, item-based, and hybrid collaborative filtering approaches with content-based matching to provide high-quality recommendations.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CollaborativeFilteringService**: Main service implementing CF algorithms
2. **HybridRecommendationService**: Combines CF with content-based matching
3. **CollaborativeFilteringController**: REST API endpoints for CF functionality
4. **User Interaction Matrix**: In-memory matrix of user interactions
5. **Similarity Cache**: Cached user similarity calculations

### Data Flow

```
User Request → CF Service → Build Interaction Matrix → Calculate Similarities → Generate Recommendations → Combine with Content-Based → Return Hybrid Results
```

## Algorithms Implemented

### 1. User-Based Collaborative Filtering

**Principle**: Find users similar to the target user and recommend their successful matches.

**Process**:
1. Calculate similarity between target user and all other users
2. Find top-N similar users
3. Get successful matches from similar users
4. Score recommendations based on similarity and match quality

**Similarity Calculation**:
```typescript
Similarity = (Skills Similarity × 0.4) + 
             (Experience Similarity × 0.2) + 
             (Bio Similarity × 0.15) + 
             (Availability Similarity × 0.1) + 
             (Interaction Similarity × 0.15)
```

**Scoring**:
```typescript
Score = Base Similarity + 
        (Feedback Score × 0.3) + 
        (Common Matches × 0.1) + 
        (Shared Preferences × 0.2)
```

### 2. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

**Principle**: Find mentors/mentees similar to those the user has successfully matched with.

**Process**:
1. Get user's successful historical matches
2. Find users similar to those matched users
3. Score based on similarity to successful matches

**Use Case**: "Users who liked this mentor also liked these similar mentors"

### 3. Hybrid Collaborative Filtering

**Principle**: Combine user-based and item-based approaches for better coverage.

**Process**:
1. Generate user-based recommendations (60% weight)
2. Generate item-based recommendations (40% weight)
3. Combine and deduplicate results
4. Sort by combined score

## Implementation Details

### User Interaction Matrix

The system builds an interaction matrix from historical data:

```typescript
interface UserInteractionMatrix {
  [userId: string]: {
    [targetUserId: string]: {
      rating: number;        // Average feedback rating
      feedback: number;      // Number of feedback entries
      duration: number;      // Match duration in days
      success: boolean;      // Whether match was successful
    };
  };
}
```

### Similarity Calculations

#### Skills Similarity (Jaccard)
```typescript
skillsSimilarity = intersection(skills1, skills2) / union(skills1, skills2)
```

#### Experience Similarity
```typescript
experienceSimilarity = 1 - (|rep1 - rep2| / max(rep1, rep2))
```

#### Text Similarity (Bio)
```typescript
textSimilarity = intersection(words1, words2) / union(words1, words2)
```

#### Interaction Similarity
```typescript
interactionSimilarity = 1 - (|avgRating1 - avgRating2| / 5)
```

### Caching Strategy

- **User Similarity Cache**: Caches similarity calculations for 1 hour
- **Interaction Matrix**: Rebuilt on each request (can be optimized)
- **Recommendation Results**: Not cached to ensure freshness

## API Endpoints

### 1. Get Collaborative Filtering Recommendations

```
GET /collaborative-filtering/recommendations/:userId
```

**Parameters**:
- `userId`: Target user ID
- `userType`: 'mentor' | 'mentee'
- `limit`: Number of recommendations (default: 10)
- `algorithm`: 'user-based' | 'item-based' | 'hybrid' (default: 'hybrid')

**Response**:
```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "targetUserId": "uuid",
      "score": 0.85,
      "confidence": 0.78,
      "reasons": [
        "Similar to user123 (75% similarity)",
        "Successful historical match with high rating"
      ],
      "algorithm": "hybrid",
      "metadata": {
        "similarityScore": 0.75,
        "feedbackScore": 4.2,
        "preferenceScore": 0.8,
        "historicalSuccess": 0.9
      }
    }
  ],
  "totalProcessed": 150,
  "executionTime": 245,
  "algorithm": "hybrid",
  "metadata": {
    "totalUsers": 1000,
    "totalMatches": 500,
    "totalFeedback": 1200,
    "averageRating": 4.1,
    "cacheSize": 45
  }
}
```

### 2. Batch Recommendations (Admin Only)

```
POST /collaborative-filtering/recommendations/batch
```

### 3. Algorithm Statistics

```
GET /collaborative-filtering/stats
```

### 4. Clear Cache

```
POST /collaborative-filtering/cache/clear
```

### 5. Health Check

```

## Hybrid Recommendation Service

### Integration with Content-Based Matching

The hybrid service combines collaborative filtering with existing content-based algorithms:

```typescript
Hybrid Score = (CF Score × 0.6) + (Content-Based Score × 0.4)
```

### Configuration Options

```typescript
interface HybridRecommendationConfig {
  cfWeight: number;        // Weight for collaborative filtering (0.6)
  cbWeight: number;        // Weight for content-based (0.4)
  minConfidence: number;   // Minimum confidence threshold (0.3)
  enableFallback: boolean; // Enable fallback to content-based
}
```

### Fallback Strategy

If collaborative filtering fails (insufficient data), the system falls back to content-based matching with a warning log.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Similarity Caching**: Cache user similarity calculations for 1 hour
2. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple users in batches
3. **Database Indexing**: Index on frequently queried fields
4. **Memory Management**: Clear old cache entries periodically

### Scalability

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Services can be scaled independently
- **Database Sharding**: User data can be sharded by region
- **Caching Layer**: Redis can be added for distributed caching

### Performance Metrics

- **Response Time**: Target < 500ms for recommendations
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Target > 80% for similarity calculations
- **Accuracy**: Measured through user feedback and match success rates

## Data Quality and Validation

### Input Validation

- User must exist and be active
- Minimum similarity threshold (0.1) to avoid noise
- Maximum recommendations limit (50) to prevent overload

### Data Quality Checks

- Verify user interaction data integrity
- Validate feedback ratings (1-5 scale)
- Check for duplicate or invalid matches

### Error Handling

- Graceful degradation when CF fails
- Fallback to content-based matching
- Comprehensive error logging and monitoring

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics

1. **Recommendation Quality**:
   - User acceptance rate
   - Match success rate
   - User satisfaction scores

2. **Algorithm Performance**:
   - Response times
   - Cache hit rates
   - Memory usage

3. **Business Metrics**:
   - Number of successful matches
   - User engagement
   - Platform growth

### Logging

```typescript
// Example log entries
logger.log(`Generated ${count} CF recommendations for user ${userId}`);
logger.warn(`CF failed, falling back to content-based: ${error.message}`);
logger.error(`Error in similarity calculation: ${error.stack}`);
```

## Testing Strategy

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// Generate hybrid recommendations
const recommendations = await hybridService.generateHybridRecommendations({
  userId: 'user123',
  type: 'mentee',
  limit: 10
});

// Get CF-only recommendations
const cfResults = await cfService.generateRecommendations(
  'user123',
  'mentee',
  10,
  'hybrid'
);
```

### Configuration

```typescript
// Update hybrid configuration
hybridService.updateConfig({
  cfWeight: 0.7,
  cbWeight: 0.3,
  minConfidence: 0.4
});

// Get current configuration
const config = hybridService.getConfig();
```

## Conclusion

The collaborative filtering implementation provides a robust foundation for mentor-mentee recommendations. By combining multiple CF approaches with content-based matching, the system delivers high-quality, personalized recommendations that improve over time as more data becomes available.

The modular design allows for easy extension and optimization, while the comprehensive monitoring ensures system reliability and performance.
